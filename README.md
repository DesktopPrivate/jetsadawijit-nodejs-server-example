This server is created to understand a little about how servers and clients work in basic command line

This server will wait for a GET request from the user to create a folder and retrieve the name via the POST method

Default port is `3000`

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Next go to [`Client`](https://github.com/DesktopPrivate/jetsadawijit-nodejs-client-example)
